# house price prediction with linear regression

For this project, we have prepared the information of almost 4000 apartments in Tehran. All data is completely real. we want to estimating  the price in dollars or tomans using the features of the data set like  Area,Room,Parking,Warehouse,Elevator,Address,Price,Price(USD)
The data is stored in the housePrice.csv file.

 hmmm .... our challenges!
in this dataset, some houses do not have addresses, and also the size of some houses is entered incorrectly (they have a very large value). For this purpose, we should also manage these items and remove them from our dataset.
Let's Go:)
